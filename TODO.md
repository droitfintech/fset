### Where to go next?

In very sparse order and requiring some additional thinking:

* Other interesting set related or relational functions, for example `powerset` or `cartisian-product`. These would build on top of fset functions but in a separate namespace. To verify effectiveness comparing with existing libs or approaches (for example math.combinatorics).
* Restrictions on the type of elements, like set of integers only, give access to bit-wise operations and speed improvements. This would be a dedicate namespace and functions.
