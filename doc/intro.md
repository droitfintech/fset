# fset performance trick

WIP

* Avoid `reduce` iteration with iterables
* Explicit arities (up to 5) when possible.
* Use transients throughout.
* Use java HashMap with the special ABox array-box objects for faster key equality
* â€¦.

TODO

* cset/rename-keys
* benchmark for different input sizes
