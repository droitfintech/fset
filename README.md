# fset - Fast set/relational library

fset is a re-implementation of the functions in Clojure [core.set](https://clojure.github.io/clojure/#clojure.set) that improves performance of set operations (including relational algebra functions like `join`, `select`, `project` etc.).

All functions are compatible with `clojure.set`. There are minor differences, for example requiring input arguments to actually implement `IPersistentSet` (`clojure.set` would sometimes allow other collection types with unpredictable results, so this is sort of a feature). The library also contains additional functions with a different interface to those in `clojure.set` to further improve speed. These functions have the same name of those in `clojure.set` but ending with "*" to indicate lack of compatibility. For example, `fset` contains both `index` and `index*`: `index` is faster than `clojure.set/index` and has the same interface. `fset/index*` is even faster than `fset/index` but it breaks compatibility with `clojure.set/index` by returning a mutable `java.util.HashMap` instead of `clojure.lang.PersistentHashMap`.

`fset` also implements other non-set related functions from `clojure.core` when they are instrumental to improve performance on `clojure.set` (this is the case of `fset/select-keys` for example).

## Usage

Add `[fset 0.1.0]` to your dependencies and then:

```clojure
(require '[fset.core :as fset]
          [clojure.set :as cset])

(def s1 (set (range 10)))
(def s2 (set (range 20)))

(= (cset/intersection s1 s2)
   (fset/intersection s1 s2))
;; true
```
