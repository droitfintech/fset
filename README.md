# fset - A Fast Set functions implementation library

fset contains a re-implementation of the function in Clojure `core.set` to improve the overall performance of set operations (including relational algebra). Some functions comes with a clojure.set-compatible version and a "native" version that breaks the standard interface to further speed up computation. You can normally just use the compatible interface which has the same name as the relative version in `clojure.set` (for example "intersection"). `fset` also re-implements other non-set related functions from `clojure.core` when they are used by set functions.

## Usage

Add `[fset 0.1.0]` to your dependencies and then:

```clojure
(require '[fset.core :as fset]
          [clojure.set :as cset])

(def s1 (set (range 10)))
(def s2 (set (range 20)))

(= (cset/intersection s1 s2)
   (fset/intersection s1 s2))
;; true
```
